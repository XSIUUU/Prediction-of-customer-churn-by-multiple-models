## Business Problem üìä
The primary goal is to predict which customers are most likely to churn and provide actionable insights for retention strategies.

> **Churn Definition**: When a customer cancels their energy service and switches to another provider.

---

## Dataset üìë
The dataset consists of **20,000 customers** with 14 variables:
- **Customer Demographics**: Age, Gender, Income
- **Contract Information**: Contract Length, Start Channel
- **Home Attributes**: Home Age, Energy Label
- **Energy Usage**: Yearly Electricity and Gas Consumption
- **Churn Status**: Target variable (1 = churned, 0 = retained)

## Project Steps üõ†
1. **Defining the Business Problem**
2. **Research Design**: Hypothesis formulation
3. **Data Preparation**: 
   - Data cleaning, transformations, and handling outliers.
4. **Exploratory Analysis**:
   - Visualizations, statistical tests, and correlation analysis.
5. **Model Development**:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Stepwise Regression
   - CART Trees
   - Bagging, Boosting
   - Random Forest
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
6. **Model Validation**:
   - Metrics: Hit Rate, Top-Decile Lift, Gini Coefficient
7. **Managerial Recommendations**

## Results üìà

| **Model**                | **Hit-Rate** | **TDL** | **Gini** |
|--------------------------|-------------:|--------:|---------:|
| Logistic Regression      | 71.2%       | 1.82    | 0.576    |
| Boosting                 | **76.83%**  | **1.92**| **0.698**|
| Random Forest (Tuned)    | 75.0%       | 1.87    | 0.65     |
| Support Vector Machines  | 74.49%      | 1.79    | 0.63     |

## Key Findings üîç
1. **Top Predictors**:
   - Electricity Usage
   - Contract Type and Length
   - Gas Usage
   - Income
2. Customers with **flexible contracts**, **high energy usage**, and **low income** are more likely to churn.
3. High accuracy and reliability were achieved using ensemble models (e.g., Boosting).
